## What is it? ##

Gamer's Table is a virtual table around which you and your friends can play games.

## Goals ##

The Gamer's Table should be able to support a wide variety of games. The initial focus is on role-playing games and their combat situations, so there are a lot of map elements and such. 

But above all, the entire project is built using JavaScript, so adding new object types and new behaviors is open and easy, and combining your own objects into groups is easy, too.

## What's Coming ##

- Removing objects
- Dice grouping
- Object-contextual menus
	- characters should be able to roll their own stats
	- dice should have color options
- Card Games
- Really long term
	- Synchronization between tables via a central server

## What's Not Coming ##

- Putting the entire ruleset of your favorite game into the box
	- You're welcome to try, but most rulesets are so full of exceptions that this is a fool's errand. Gamer's Table is meant to be an aid to the game, not the game itself. You're the one playing, not the board!
