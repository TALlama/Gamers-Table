## What is it? ##

Games require a lot of pieces. You need a big table to put everything out on, but it needs to be small enough that everyone can reach. You need a wide variety of pieces, but you need to get them to your game night. What if you could make the whole thing virtual?

Gamer's Table is that virtual table full of pieces; it runs entirely in your browser, so it's easy to use. It's built on JavaScript and is open source, so it's easy to extend and build on. And it's free and MIT licensed, so you can use it however you want.

## Goals ##

The Gamer's Table should be able to support a wide variety of games. The initial focus is on role-playing games and their combat situations, so there are a lot of map elements and such. 

But above all, the entire project is built using JavaScript, so adding new object types and new behaviors is open and easy, and combining your own objects into groups is easy, too. Making everything scale from simple drag-pieces-around games all the way up to complex die-grouping, card-shuffling, token-trading games is the idea.

## What's Coming ##

See the [issues tracker](http://github.com/TALlama/Gamers-Table/issues) for what's being looked at.

Much longer term:

- Card Games
- Synchronization between tables via a central server

## What's Not Coming ##

- Putting the entire ruleset of your favorite game into the box
	- You're welcome to try, but most rulesets are so full of exceptions that this is a fool's errand. Gamer's Table is meant to be an aid to the game, not the game itself. You're the one playing, not the board!
